Convert the techchallenge script into a binary executable, you can use a tool called shc (Shell Script Compiler). This tool compiles a shell script into a standalone binary. Here’s a step-by-step 

Create directory to save logs somewhere and give required permissions
sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/somewhere
sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/somewhere/logger
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/cache/somewhere/logger
sudo chown -R $USER /var/cache/somewhere/logger

Step 1: Install shc

If shc is not already installed on your system, you can usually install it via your package manager.

    On Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install shc build-essential

Step 2: Compile the Script with shc

Once shc is installed, you can use it to convert your techchallenge script into a binary executable.

    Navigate to the directory where techchallenge is located.

    Run shc with the following command:

    shc -f techchallenge

        The -f option specifies the filename of the shell script you want to compile.

This command will produce two new files in the same directory:

    techchallenge.x: The compiled binary executable.
    techchallenge.x.c: The C source code generated by shc (not typically needed unless you want to inspect or further modify it).

Step 3: Rename and Move the Binary

To make the compiled binary easier to use, rename it and (optionally) move it to a location in your PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin), so you can run it from anywhere.

    Rename the binary:

mv techchallenge.x techchallenge

Move it to a directory in your PATH (optional, requires sudo privileges):

    sudo mv techchallenge /usr/local/bin/

Step 4: Run the Binary

You can now run techchallenge directly as a binary command.

    To start the challenge:

techchallenge start

To finish the challenge:

    techchallenge finish

Important Notes

    The binary will behave just like the original script but will be in compiled form.
    If you modify the original shell script, you’ll need to recompile it to reflect the changes in the binary.
    Be cautious with shc on complex scripts, as it may not fully support every advanced shell feature.
